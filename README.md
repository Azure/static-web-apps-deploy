# GitHub Action for deploying to Azure Static Web Apps

This Github Action enables developers to build and publish their applications to Azure App Service Static Web Apps. This action utilizes [Oryx](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx) to detect and build an application, then uploads the resulting application content, as well as any Azure Functions, to Azure.
